This is an example set of ROS packages that configures the necessary resources for getting a robot up and running in a gazebo simulation.

It accompanies my [Navigate Gazebo Worlds](http://nlamprian.me/blog/software/ros/2019/12/26/navigate-gazebo-worlds/) and [Visual Servoing in Gazebo](http://nlamprian.me/blog/software/ros/2020/01/27/visual-servoing-in-gazebo/) blog posts.
